# Pokemon Description Project

This project explores the application of deep learning techniques to solve two interconnected tasks:

1. **Pokemon Type Classification**: Predicting the types of Pokemon from their images.
2. **Pokemon Description Generation**: Generating descriptive text for Pokemon using features learned during the classification task.

This comprehensive project emphasizes the integration of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) through advanced deep learning methodologies and transfer learning.

## Approach

### 1. **Pokemon Type Classification**
To classify Pokemon types, three distinct deep learning architectures were implemented and evaluated:

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A foundational model for image classification, designed to extract spatial features effectively.
- **CNN with Attention Mechanism**: Enhanced with mechanisms like CBAM to focus on the most salient parts of the images, improving feature representation.
- **Transformer Model**: Leveraging vision transformers (ViT) to capture long-range dependencies and complex patterns within the images.

#### Key Steps:
- **Data Preparation**: The dataset underwent preprocessing, including normalization, augmentation, and splitting into training, validation, and testing subsets.
- **Model Training**: Each model was trained using optimized hyperparameters, and performance was rigorously evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

### 2. **Transfer Learning for Description Generation**
Transfer learning was employed to generate descriptive text based on the visual features learned during the classification task.

#### Process:
1. **Feature Extraction**: 
   - The classification models were frozen, and their final classification layers removed.
   - Feature vectors from the penultimate layer were extracted and used as input for the description generation models.

2. **Text Generation Models**:
   - **LSTM-based Model**: A Long Short-Term Memory network, adept at handling sequential data, was used to transform extracted features into coherent descriptions.
   - **Transformer Model**: A transformer-based architecture was implemented for generating more context-aware and detailed descriptions.

#### Objective:
This step aimed to repurpose the visual features learned during type classification to create meaningful textual descriptions, effectively demonstrating the power of transfer learning in bridging computer vision and NLP tasks.

## Technical Skills Employed
- **Deep Learning Architectures**: CNNs, attention mechanisms, vision transformers, and LSTMs.
- **Transfer Learning**: Adapting pre-trained models for new tasks, optimizing resource usage and improving performance.
- **Data Processing**: Data cleaning, augmentation, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Evaluation Techniques**: Implementing and analyzing performance metrics to select the best-performing models.
- **NLP Techniques**: Tokenization, sequence modeling, and text generation using LSTM and transformer models.

## Results and Insights
- **Classification Task**: Comparative analysis revealed the strengths and weaknesses of CNN, CNN with attention, and transformer models. Attention-enhanced CNNs showed improved performance in identifying subtle features, while transformers excelled in handling complex patterns.
- **Description Generation**: The transfer learning approach successfully leveraged visual features to produce accurate and contextually relevant descriptions. Transformer-based models outperformed LSTM models in generating detailed and coherent text.

This project highlights the seamless integration of deep learning techniques across computer vision and natural language processing domains, showcasing the potential of transfer learning to solve complex, multi-modal problems.
